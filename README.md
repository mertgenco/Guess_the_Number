# Guess_the_Number
ARM Assembly Guess the Number Game.

Guess the Number is a unique game which one can compete with the machine. In the game, the system generates a random number and users tries to guess the number by clicking KEY buttons. 

KEY0 - increases “1”
KEY1 - decreases “1”
KEY2 - increases “10”
KEY3 - decreases “10”

By default click live is 30 and the game also allows users to edit their click lives. Each click to KEY buttons decreases “1” from lives. Also tips will be given to the users by displaying “LT” (Lower than), “HT” (Higher than). If a user can finish the game without spending his all lives, “COOL” will be displayed on the LED.

You have 30 click lives! You can try out this mini game by compiling and running it @ https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc
